# Introduction

This package is for computing metrics, especially using adaptation of the original svcca, pwcca.

# LICENSE

Due to original authors we are adding their license here and adding list of changes  
in the `./cca/NOTICE` file:

Changes:
    - all additions to the original svcca library are in file `uutils_cca_core_addendums.py`

## Licensing comment

My understanding from opensource SO:
> You can use (and modify) the codebase of the Apache component under the Apache license. You cannot re-license the 
> Apache code to use MIT in the future, because there are addnl restrictions in the Apache license (stating changes, 
> trademark use) which do not appear in the MIT license.
> I always recommend to have one file licenses.md (or .txt or whatever) either in the top folder or in a 
> 'licenses' subfolder, and include everything in that one file. In addition you should put a 'notices.md' into the 
> same folder with the copyright attribution, list of changes etc. Some people put the notices in the same file with 
> the licenses, but I think that makes it very difficult to read.

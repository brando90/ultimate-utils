# ---- Negotiations ---- 
Note: current notes are very rough. Need to do some heavy organizing. Take everything written witha grain of salt. 

# Prompt: Hypothetical whole sample negotiation with tips, specificiations and suggested processes
## Always follow these tips as a candidate (or even employer, hiring manager)
Before you negotiatione, always be:
```markdown
- Always be polite, respectful and keep relationship warm (no matter your emotions), yet, be firm on your needs/wants (yeses) and (healthy) boundaries (nos)
- Do not be defensive, do not attack, do not accusatory, do not make assumptions
- Do not be judgmental e.g., you do not like the current offer for example, X is a bad offer
- Do not argue or make your case (especially if role/level has not been decided or you don't understand the current proposal)
- Treat negotiations as a common hurdle/challenge to resolve as a team (assuming you are interested in genuinely joining their team)
- Help me overcome our blocks -- let me help you
- Good negotiations are not an adverserial game
```
## Step 1: Delay a salary conversation if both of you are not convinced this is a good mutual fit or you do not know your role/level
Tips:
```markdown
- never ever share your previous salaries
- It's illegal for companies to ask your previous salaries in CA, but in CA an employer must provide the salary band for a specific role/level if asked
- They can still ask for your salary expectations (and often will early in the interview/negotiation process)
- Respond politely though firmly that it's too early to discuss salary at this stage
- Every employer will ask this no matter what, every experienced professional know to not respond
- Do not be afraid to (politely) stand your ground (and not share any info you are not ready to share e.g., salary when you guys don't know if you're a good fit)
- FAQ, so when are you are likely ready to discuss salary (tot comp/total compensation)? when you 1. agree it's a mutual good fit 2. understand your role, level, contribution 3. why they need you/why are you unique
```
The following conversation is a sample script of how to respectfully yet firmly dekat to negotiate a salary when both of you are not ready:
```markdown
- Employer/Recruiter/Hiring Manger: What salary are you looking for?
- Candidate: I think this is a bit too early to discuss salary. I need to learn more about my contributions, and role in the team. And would love to discuss that once we get closer.
- Emplyer/Recuriter/Hiring Manger: Well Brando, I want to make sure I don't waste your time. Can you give me a range?
- Candidate: I appreciate your concerns, but I'm sure we will be able to discuss once we come to an agreement that we are a mutual good fit, but it's too early to tell.
- Canditate (opt2): I appreciate your thoughtfulness. But I think I need to understand my role, main contributions, and fit in the team before we discuss that. I'm this will help us understand if we are a mutual good fit and then move forward to discuss that.
```
The following is a conversation on how to figure out if you're a good git:
```markdown
Candidate: Hi! Thanks for making time to chat/answer my questions and congrats on your growing start up. I really believe it's valuable. 
Employer: Thank you. I sincerely appreciate it.
Candidate: I wanted to understand my expected contribution, my role and how I fit in the team. May you expand on those for me please?
Emplyer: ...
```
At some point later they might extend an offer. For the candidate this will be a fact finding converstation. 
Share your excitment about the new job. But resist the urge to react to the numbers, share your previous salary, argue or try to make your case, or give your range.
If the tot comp is higher than you expected, do not act surprised or let it come across:
```markdown
Employer: Hi Brando! The team was very excited to to meet you and I'd love to share the details of the offer (from https://aipaygrad.es/ median):
$150K/year base salary, $105/year RSU (over 4 years, 1 year cliff), and $20K sign on bonus. 
Candidate: Thank you for the offer, really excited about the team/vision! I'll need some time to review this. In the meantime, I have a few questions for you.
Employer: Sure! Go ahead.
```
Our goal is to collect all the information and retreat to aplace where we can analyze all the details, with a cool head.
Follow up with some of these questions:
```markdown
Q1: First type of questions:
What level is the job offer? What are the requirements/responsibilities for this job level compared to the above?

Q2: 
Politely yet directly; What is the salary band for this level?
This is a 100% reasonable to ask and they are legally required to give it if asked.

Q3:
How much is the equity worth currently? What percetange of the company does the equity represent? (also know the different types of equities e.g., RSU, options, equity, stocks, shares). What is the valuation of the company?

Q4:
What is the vesting (& cliff) schedule? Are there quarterly vesting deadlines I should know about? Confirm that the equity was quoted to you over a yearly basis or 4 years.

Q5:
For stock options what is the strke pirce (recall option := contract that you can but are not obliged to buy stocks at a later time at the strike price)
How long after I leave the company do I have to exercise the options?
```

# Step2: Discuss the right level for you and negotiate the level (& eventually the higher end of the band for your level)
Remember when discussing salary:
```markdown
- Do not accept a lower salary/pay because you don't need the money. How much you need to be paid has nothing to do with your costs. It's 100% supply and demand. 
    - How unique/valuable are your skills in the market? (supply)
    - How much does the employer need your unique skill set? Or other contributions you bring to the company (demmand).
- You have a market value and the employer does not care about your costs (morgage, student debt, etc.). Your total comp. is based on your market value and their needs for you. Arguments surrounding life costs will be unconvincing to recruiters. Your skills have a market value.
- What you do with that money has no place in the compensation conversation.

Also, remember hiring is really hard (you know it first hand with undergraduate researchers!)
- The company just spent 10s of thousands finding you, vetting you, interviewing you, etc.
- They spent/"wasted" a bunch of time/money considering unqualified candidates
- The hiring manager **needed** the job filled months ago and now they finally have you.
- Everybody wants this deal to happen.

Remember:
- Level and role is the biggest lever that determines compensation
- Each level/role has a salary band/range (there are seperate bans for base and equity)
Warning:
- Don't forget that a higher level isn't just free higher salary, it comes with higher job expectations
- It's usually better to be at the higher end of a salary band for a lower level (or approximately a little above the value you think you deserve if you tend to have to high expectations for example)
What you should go for:
-**You should target a level you are confident you would be promoted to within a year and target the higher end of that band** <*> https://chat.openai.com/c/b518905a-fa21-446a-a9da-3825df9e2a4f 
```
Sample conversation to discuss level/role:
```markdown
Candidate: Hi! Hope you're doing well. Would love to understand role/levels more a bit more -- what distinguishes an applied research scientist L3 vs a technical staff L4?
Employer: ...
or
Candidate: Hi! Would love to understand level/role better. What is the difference between an L7 over an L6?
Emplyer: L7 are generally people who have lead any wide projects with many cross-functional partner and executive visibility.
...some time later...
Candidate: Hi! Can we revist my offer level? In my current role, I lead a major company-wide infrastructure redesign with regular checkins with the CTO.
It really seems like L7 might be a better and would love to set me up for success.
```
Remember
```markdown
Advice:
- If you want to move up a level, master the art of listening carefully and repeating.
- Earlier you asked about the qualifications/job responsibilities for the higher level.
- **When you ask for a level change clearly connect your qualifications/experience to the requirements laid out by the recruiter/hiring manager.**
```

# Step3: Once the level is set, negotiate/discuss the higher end of the band for that level
Once you're convinced your current level is right for you (see <*>), then target for **the higher end of that band** for your level.
Once you have a number, be **firm and specific**.
**Only negotiate if you mean it. You should be willing to genuiinely commit if the other side can get to your number.**
If you still have reservations about the company (or the level), you are not ready to negotiate tot comp. Deal with that first. 
**The most reliable way to get more comp is through competing offers.** Consider interviewing with your 2nd and 3rd choice.
It's possible to get offers above the higher end of your band, but only strong candidates with strong competing offers get that and it requires extra levels of approval.
Do not back down on total compensation. If you cannot get the total comp you want, be creative e.g, remember how Ramit Sethi did not back down, tried to get other forms of compensation and even suggested an accelerated performance review process for promotion.

# -- Collection of nice phrases
It's important to carry on the positive relationship that you built in the interview phase (or collaboration phase), to negotiation phase. 

Phrases:
- word/phrase switch: `negotiate --> discuss, converse, talk about`
- word/phrase switch: `raise salary --> adjust salary` (e.g., don't make it feel your taking from them)
- word/phrase switch: `adjust offer` 
- word/phrase switch: `I'm sorry I can't accept 80K base salary --> I'm excited for the team and enjoyed meeting everyone. In terms of total compensation, I'm looking for something closer to 250k. Would you be open to a base salary of $160K? (or whatever the # is for your uppoer band for your role, if you identify yourself as a top performer).`
- word/phrase switch: `I can't do X --> I don't think I can do at the current level -- 250k tot comp is what I need to be able to sign. Can you be more flexible somewhere else, e.g., Equity? What about 20K for equiaty and the rest signing bonus -- that would get us to $250K. ... reply tough but I will see what I can do ... -> Ok I understand. I'm ready to sign if we can get to that number.`

Soft considerations:
- Keep relationship warm
- Empathy:
    - Acknowledge their efforts
    - Be grateful

Heuristics
- Stick to respectfully but firmly to your total compensation

- TODO: understand IP and limitations after leaving morph is.

Common Counters from Recruiters/Hiring Managers:
- Economy is bad
- This is the best we can offer, since this is a fairly junior role

Typical right now
    - 4 year vesting, 1 year cliff to give you 1/4 of your equity
    - 0.5 - 1% typical equity for founding/1st software engineer/applied scientist

TODOs:
- phrase, I'd like to clarify/understand/help why the offer is so low
- " ", I'd like to clarify how the publications will work, especially wrt my thesis
- offer is pretty bad --> 
- be grateful for the offer and show excimenent
- you need to arrive at a proposal that you'd agree to if offered
- they don't care about your costs, just the value you provide for them
- So I assume I should explicitly yet respectfully ask why is the offer so low. perhaps a modification of your offer to them that augments what you think they want to help you get what you want.
- you are rushing me --> `this is a big ask, that is comming to quickly, and it's my 1st job coming out of academia. I need to understand things`

- SK good comments
    - good for you to calibrate on how much your joining them might change their outcome i.e., will it take them longer without you, or is there some special IP, or skillset you have that is hard to hire for in the open market?
    - (also, do you think it's ok to ask them questions on writing?) Always ok to try to get things in writing. They will ask for a meeting if they dont want to put things in writing... Sometimes this is informative
    - In the end, everyone is optimizing for self interest. good for you to calibrate on how much your joining them might change their outcome i.e., will it take them longer without you, or is there some special IP, or skillset you have that is hard to hire for in the open market?
    - Can be useful to try and see things from their perspective to better understand the value proposition, and perhaps a modification of your offer to them that augments what you think they want to help you get what you want.
        - hence the call to self-reclection. So its goos to not just think oif your passion, but how they as a company in the space, and a potential competitior (if you choose not to work with them) might view things
esp since the space is specialized and narrower than the rest of the field

- Pedro good advice -- understand value proposition, your role and why they need you
    - when the offer is not competitive according to the market (or your own feelings of how good you are relative to the market, go for upper band always once role & contributions are agreed upon/clear), then try to understand 
        - 1. your role in the company
        - 2. why the gap exists (with the median or the top band of the level you feel you can deliver at)
    - understand the gap
    - what is my role and what is the median
    - no point in doing a 180k counter offer when their lower offer is already super low (1/2 of the lowest band for the role you think matches your skills)
    - (not sure if this is true, need to read contract + non-compete laws but I have this on my notes from yesterday: First, thank you for the offer and I'm excited for the project, enjoyed meeting the team & company's vision. In terms of total compensation I'm looking for something closer to at least the median 340K, though I consider myself a top perfomer (median, but you should always negotiate upper band but in my case the offer is so low that perhaps upper band is too aggressive or perhaps just saying a straight no, but actually discussing & understanding hap is a better step but for the sake of writing something here we go). Would you be open for a base salary of 160K -- note this is still median and I am a top performer (still median, not upper band, not condor's advice))? I know this might seem high, especially given the initial offer, but these are the median numbers in the tech industry. 
        - Given RS non compete, do you think you're actually losing a lot of freedom?
            - already know I can do whatever I want in free time. Div/Dq/Alg (ok) is not a problem
            - but what about projects already in ML4Maths/Autoform
                - MAF, AF ft
                - other similar projs that might arise
            - am I really losing freedom given non compete RS sent
                - don't understand how trade secret interacts with above
                - I'd assume Ari's research is a trade secret but he is at a start up...?!
        - TODO: rephrase, tot comp is not enough to value I'd be bringing + market values 
        - TODO what impact would you bring? (unique skills, great software eng, data pipeline unique + expesnive)

- IP & thesis interaction
    - SK
        - TODO
    - Jesse
        - can't put it on paper, but it's in his benefit to publish. He has high standard (good!). 

- Numbers
    - divs: 120-180K base, 0.5%-1% equity range software engineer/applied scientists. 
        - median:
            - 150k (but aipaygrades says 160K is base for big tech https://aipaygrad.es/) 
            - 0.5% equity (4 year vesting 1 year cliff)
            - it's full time, not contractor. 

Process:
- First, delay salary conversations until **both** of you are convinced this is the right job. 
    - Never ever share your previous salary.
    - They can still ask salary expectations at this stage (trying to figure out if you guys are right fit).
    - Politely & respectfully, yet firmly say you don't know or are not comfortable sharing at this stage. Repeat 3 times if needed. People will not ask for a 4th, 5th time once you already said no. 
    - Don't be afraid to stand your ground.
    - TODO: write sample of how to stand your ground in case of asked to give salary expectations when you're not ready. 
- One you guys know you are good fit,
    - share your excitment about the new job BUT, control every urge to
        - overly show excitment
        - react to the numbers
        - share your previous salary
        - arguing or trying to make your case
        - don't act surprised or let it come across
- 

Tips:
- They are legally required to give salary band if asked
- if you do say a number, always use objective market values e.g.,
    - X is half the median base salary for level Y
- Understand their needs so you can argue/discuyss your case from a place that benefits them
- understand their needs and wants, and why you are unique and how you contribute to them to get things faster
- if they are a start up -- make sure to understand 1. their business model (if possible) 2. how they get revenue
- if you ask what your contributions to the team is, you indirectly learn why they need you
- you can also politely ask why they need you
- 
- I understand understanding why I'm unique is important because:
1. it tells me why the want me/why I'm unique
2. argue the value I bring to them (since it's wrt their wants/needs)
- do I know how they hire? (TODO: why does this matter?) https://claude.ai/chat/b2ef4bb9-d58a-4cd5-896c-dec263aedd91
-
- If they are hard to work with it might be ego. If it's ego, then affirm him. e.g., compliment him e.g., his start up, the vision of the company. 

- ask similar question, even about things that have already been said (e.g., comments in passing). To really get the truth out/test for deceit. Is he being consistent. If it has changed, what details has changed. This the tactics the police/FBI etc. uses to ensure truth/consistency. 

TODO: read poker face theorem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_poker

- CS Stanford has 1 year limit of sabatial leave of absence
- friends that are VC their thoughts can help guage value of start up comapnies you join
    - e.g., crash mentioned to always have it clear what their revenue plan is
- help them help you, be creative e.g., more frequent performance evals, helping them get seed funding, producing business models, revenue ideas
- who's compute (premises, resources) we use determines IP
- why does it matter who owns IP? (TODO)
- you can always put in the acknowledgment + first page "work done with at morph/ibm/google etc"

- fellowship (?)

- 50% CA/RA stanford (20h/w)
    - Jay wasn't clear but I assume the reamining 40% is whatever I want e.g., I am a student
    - I assume never 100% to avoid benefits/tax issues? (university wide hack/loop hole, doesn't seem nice)
- summer
    - 50 - 90
- total
    - 50k tuition
    - 5k health insurance
    - 30k stipend (36-40/h)

Hi Jesse! 
On Monday you mentioned you supported me making an informed decision and I appreciate it. One question I am curious about is the revenue plan for Morph. Do you mind sharing this with me? Hope you're recovering fromy our jetlagg! They are really annoying.  

## Exploding Offer, Tight Deadlines

If you're told the offer has a hard deadline (an “exploding offer”)

Sometimes a tight deadline is legitimate but often it’s a mechanism to prevent you from looking around too much. “Exploding offers” are a bad industry practice and unfortunately very common with new grad offers, where companies are trying to lock down candidates before everyone else.

Here’s a secret: if you renege on a signed job offer, nothing bad will happen. You might get told it’ll ruin your reputation, but especially in a large company, you'll be fine.

You’re going to dedicate years of your productive life to an organisation, it’s perfectly reasonable to make the best decision for you. Don’t sign an offer you intend to renege on, but especially in face of questionable ethical behavior, don’t feel bad if you have to walk it back.

# Thoughts to Clean Up

## The general thought process on messaging people from Sim

So here is **the general thought process I use when working on messaging people**. The first and most important is what is this message going to tell her about you, is it a favorable to your end goal or not. With this in mind I then go through the profile. If possible I will try and use any context clues about her. So for instance, what is she wearing, what shoes, hair, what does her style tell me about her. Where is she in the photos, does what’s in the photos match what is going on  in the bio. Who else is in the pictures. What is she emphasizing in here bio? Are there things she is speaking about that I also am interested in? After going through the bio this is when I start plotting out the iceburgh. This is how I set my pace from one convo to another. I will normally try and formulate anchor points to help keep the conversation moving as I go through questions in order. The goal is to try and cover my anchors over 3 days and if things are going well and the stream of communication is consistent, that is when I ask for the date. I also try and use poetic language if I can. Important to note, you want the messages to come off as conversational and not an interview. I always try and position as the safe place to come chat. 

## Specific to Academia 


## 

You should target the level you are confident you can be promoted within a year, and target the higher end of that band.

Why is this good advice for salary negotiations? https://chat.openai.com/c/b518905a-fa21-446a-a9da-3825df9e2a4f 
```
This statement touches on several aspects of salary negotiations and career progression. Here's why it can be considered good advice:

1. **Realistic Expectations**: By targeting a level where you believe you can be promoted within a year, you're aiming for a position that aligns with your current skills and potential. It means you're not underselling or overselling yourself, both of which can have negative repercussions.

2. **Motivation and Performance**: If you're in a role where you believe you can advance quickly, you're more likely to be motivated to perform at your best. This can lead to better results for both you and your employer.

3. **Rapid Value Growth**: If you're promoted within a year, the value you bring to the company rises quickly. From the employer's perspective, this can be seen as a return on investment. They've hired someone at a particular salary band, and within a year, they've grown into a more valuable asset without a significant initial overpay.

4. **Higher End of the Band**: Negotiating for the higher end of the salary band gives you room for growth even without a promotion. Salary bands often account for differences in experience and skill within the same role. By aiming for the higher end, you're pushing for a salary that rewards your specific experience and potential contributions. It also gives you a buffer in case you don't get a promotion or raise as soon as you expect.

5. **Leverage**: By targeting the higher end of your appropriate salary band, you’re starting the negotiation from a strong position. Even if there's some pushback from the employer, there's room to negotiate down slightly and still land a satisfactory offer. Starting too low doesn't give you this leverage.

6. **Psychological Aspect**: Research suggests that people often equate salary with self-worth. While it's essential to separate one's intrinsic value from their paycheck, being compensated fairly can have a significant positive effect on self-esteem and job satisfaction.

7. **Prevents Future Discontent**: Starting at a salary below your worth can lead to dissatisfaction down the line, especially when you find out peers in similar roles are earning more. This can negatively impact your morale, motivation, and loyalty to the company.

8. **Market Rate**: By understanding your value in the marketplace and what others in similar positions are earning (through research on platforms like Glassdoor, PayScale, etc.), you're better equipped to negotiate effectively. If you're confident in your ability to be promoted within a year, it likely means you're aware of your market value.

Of course, while this is generally good advice, it's essential to consider specific industries, company cultures, and individual circumstances when negotiating. Some industries or companies may have set structures with limited negotiation room, while others might be more flexible. It's always crucial to do your homework and understand the landscape before entering negotiations.

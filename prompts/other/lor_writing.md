It is with great pleasure that I write this letter to strongly support Patrick Yu for admission to [X] at [Y]. Patrick has engaged in undergraduate research with my Ph.D. student Brando Miranda, where Patrick has displayed remarkable initiative and curiosity – which led to key contributions to our research project. His persistent drive to question and understand led us to move beyond metrics based on popular notions like CCA and instead move to distribution-based metrics – like the Hellinger distance. This was crucial because his mentor was unknowingly “stuck” and this helped us move forward in a quantifiable, actionable, and novel way. This shows Patrick’s ability to pursue ideas independently, understand the problem statement of the project, and arrive at a creative solution. In addition, I believe this key contribution made one of the strongest defenses of our entire approach in the work we will be presenting at NeurIPS 2022 as a workshop paper. This shows Patrick is capable of making not only engineering contributions, but conceptual contributions that get papers accepted. With this idea, we were able to demonstrate that the ground truth diversity correlated strongly with our own diversity coefficient – giving solid grounding to our experiments that our novel diversity metrics.
In addition, he also showed how his idea of using Hellinger distance to generate the synthetic data for our experiments results in more stable optimization than the popular KL divergence. Patrick’s natural leadership was also displayed when he helped onboard a fellow undergraduate researcher (Nikil) to the team. Patrick helped Nikil set up the code and understand the foundations of the project – foundations that Patrick learned independently through reading three research papers his mentor assigned. In addition, this shows Patrick’s ability to understand state-of-the-art machine learning research – which is remarkable for a sophomore. 
I’d like to emphasize Patrick’s unique initiative through his effective use of modern communication tools (like Discord) – which have consistently led to fruitful discussions. In a set of over 15 students, Brando has mentored – he has never had a student be this eager to understand and push the project’s boundaries. This shows leadership, ownership of the project, and genuine enthusiasm to engage in research. Furthermore, Patrick’s enthusiasm has led to weekly meetings – which was also unique compared to Brando’s previous mentoring experience. Finally and perhaps most crucially, he is able to use this communication tool in a structured way that does not fragment his attention – contrary to what these tools tend to do. For example, he responds at predictable times and does not show signs he is on it all the time. Patrick also successfully used state-of-the-art visualization techniques to display his experimental findings. 
I’d like to emphasize Patrick’s ability to give insightful and honest, constructive feedback for our 15-minute contributed talk. It can often be scary to give feedback to an older mentor, and he does it effectively. In particular, he was able to explain that the hypothesis “that a small model might benefit from meta-learning” is not understandable for someone not working directly on our project. This greatly improved that slide for our contributed talk at NeurIPS.
Patrick is also taking graduate classes – although is only a junior! In addition, he uses this classes effectively not only to learn the state of the art but also to get feedback for our own research projects. In particular, this helped us take the decision to move on from synthetic benchmarks and focus on large-scale benchmarks that are valued more by the machine-learning community. Concretely, he used the class CS 598 “Learning to Learning” with Yu-Xiong to learn more about meta-learning and to get this crucial feedback for our project. This shows his independence to take relevant classes, seek advice and improve our project. I’d also like to emphasize that he is able to do all this while taking a full class load as an undergraduate (junior!) – taking advanced CS classes. For example, the systems class he is taking requires immense patience and engineering skills to do successfully. In addition, he also attends my lab meetings – and is not afraid to learn and ask about topics he wants to learn about. In addition, he is also capable of offering useful insights to other lab members through discord. For example, he suggested an idea that as a professor I would have endorsed to visualize high dimensional fMRI data using powerful feature extractors with t-SNE/PCA dimensionality reductions and clustering. I publicly endorsed this to our lab and Brando mentioned to me he personally learned something from it. Therefore, reminding his own mentor that simplicity can often be valuable in science. 
I’d like to focus on Patrick’s capabilities to tackle large engineering challenges. With the feedback he independently got from professor Wang in cs 598 – we decided to tackle experimenting with a large-scale data set of size 216 GB like Meta-Data set. He was capable of understanding the abstraction of the code to use that to be able to train it with our existing code. In addition, even the seemingly simple task of managing and downloading the data can be very challenging. He has shown to Brando (his mentor) preliminary results of diversity computations and continues to make progress to train on such a challenging task. I believe we will have results ready for ICML 2023 next given Patrick’s consistent efforts to get things done.
Patrick’s has an outstanding number of awards: Outstanding Project Award in the 2021 University of Illinois Undergraduate Research Symposium (URS) for the project titled “Pan-Cancer Survival Classification with Clinicopathologic and Targeted Gene Expression Features”, conference Travel Grant Award Recipient (October 2021) from Grainger College of Engineering for my presentation at the Sigma Xi Student Research Conference for the project titled “Integrative Genomic Characterization of Therapeutic Targets for Pancreatic Cancer”, Illinois Engineering Achievement Scholarship Award (October 2021) from the Grainger College of Engineering and Engineering Visionary Scholarship Award (September 2021) from the Grainger College of Engineering. He also has an impeccable transcript with 8 A+s, 5 As, 21 advanced placement tests, perfect GPA 4.0. Patrick has demonstrated a phenomenal track record for research, including a productive high school internship at Duke University. During this internship, he was the lead coauthor for a manuscript that was published at International Conference on Cloud Computing (2019). One year before, they published related work at a workshop at the prestigious NeurIPS conference – again as lead coauthor. As a high school student, Patrick was again a lead coauthor on a manuscript, which is exceedingly rare given the immense amount of time it takes to learn the subject and contribute in a meaningful way. As a high school student, he also achieved a Perfect Score on the AP Computer Science A exam – an achievement that only “one of 193 students, amounting to 0.295% of all students”. In addition, Patrick earned the 2022-2023 University of Illinois ISUR Scholar for the project titled “Impact of Task Diversity on the Performance of Meta-Learned Models”. In this he already practiced his presentation skills by making a solid poster about his ongoing work.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley. I came to know Jane when I was her Graduate Student Instructor for Philosophy 111: Ethical Relativism, taught by Professor John Smith. The course comprised [short description of course]. Jane distinguished herself by submitting an exceptionally well researched and interesting project on ethical practices in ancient Greece. I would rank her in the top 2% of students that I have taught in the past five years in respect of her writing ability and research skills. Overall, Jane is highly intelligent and has good analytical skills. Her project on ethical practices in ancient Greece demonstrated her ability to come a detailed understanding of the ethical practices of another, very different, culture, and to analyze the consequences of those practices for contemporary ethical theories. She gave a particularly interesting discussion of the difficult practice of infanticide, and showed both sensitivity and detachment when discussing its ethical consequences. Her overall intelligence is also reflected in her grades for the course, which were by far the best in the class. Jane has excellent communication skills. Her written work is both clear and concise, as well as interesting to read. She demonstrated her oral articulateness in the discussion sections that were an integral part of the course. Each discussion section focused on a particular ethical dilemma. Students were required analyze morally problematic situations, and to develop and argue for their own ethical views with regard to the issue in question. Jane was highly proficient in applying the course material in analyzing the problem situations. She always explained her views very concisely and gave supporting arguments that were both clear and persuasive. Jane also demonstrated good teamwork skills in group assignments. At a personal level, Jane is a well disciplined, industrious student with a pleasant personality. She went well beyond the course requirements in the quantity and quality of her project, putting in a lot of extra research and attending office hours every week. Throughout the course, Jane demonstrated great perseverance and initiative. Not only was she interested in and motivated to learn the material, but she also put great work into assimilating it to her own experience and developing her own ideas about each ethical topic that we discussed. Jane is unquestionably an exceptional candidate for graduate study in Ethics. Jane’s work in Philosophy 111 suggests that she would greatly benefit from the opportunities for intellectual development provided by a sustained period of graduate study. She has proven herself to have the perseverance, initiative, and Sample letter of recommendation intellectual creativity necessary to complete an advanced graduate degree.

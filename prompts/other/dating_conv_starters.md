See the ones I have, are all based on my or sim's insights first. 


# Protocol:
Identify the anchor points that connect you and the women you want to message based on her profile.
Use the infomation on her bio, aboout, pictures and the topics you connect with her and can develop.
After 3 days ask her for a date & get her out of the app.

Anchor points about sarit:

# How to ask simple questions into unique deeper enticing questions that raise interest.
I want to translate a mundane question into a deep question, that raises the interest in me from the person (women) receiving my message.
To make it enticing and motivate a reponse from her -- it should help her realize or learn something about herself or about you, ideally about common values or interests.
Example translations:
```
-- General Format:
> instead of: mudane question,
instead ask: 
deep question that raises her interest in you
-- Examples:
> instead of: what's your favorite book,
instead ask: what traits do your top 5 books have in common
> instead of: what is your favorite place to travel,
instead ask: what draws you to nations around the world
> instead of: what is your favorite colour -->
instead ask: what is unique about the feeling that you get about your favorite colour
> instead of: what's your favorite food,
instead ask: what is the way that you feel when eating your favorite food that is different from other foods
> instead of: Who is your favorite artist?
instead ask: What emotions or memories do your favorite artists' music evoke for you?
> instead of: What are your values?
instead ask: How have your values shaped your decisions and life experiences, and have they evolved over time?

Instead of: Do you like spicy food?
Instead ask: How does experiencing different flavors and cuisines influence your appreciation for food and culture?
Instead of: Have you traveled much?
Instead ask: How have your travel experiences broadened your perspectives on cultures and societies?

Instead of: Do you work out?
Instead ask: How does maintaining physical health contribute to your sense of well-being and overall lifestyle?

Instead of: What are your goals?
Instead ask: How do your goals reflect what you value most in life, and what motivates you to achieve them?

Instead of: What do you usually do on the weekends?
Instead ask: How do your weekend activities reflect your priorities and values?

Instead of: What’s your favorite movie?
Instead ask: What is it about your favorite movie that resonates with you on a personal level?
```
Don't ask her a basic question, follow the technique above where you raise her interest, and have her have fun.
To raise her interest, have her associate her with things about me that we have in common, ideally values. 
Write a message so that she is curious about me -- mystery is good.

The message should engage the women, and increase her interest in me
e.g., through shared values, curiosity, etc.
It should lead to a positive safe conversation.
It should not be: needy, overly exaggerated, pompous, confrontational or shallow.
It is fine if it's funny, witty, flirty (without overdoing it) yet mature and shows I'm a stable independent man that is high value.
Help me translate it to make raise her interest and entice a response.
It shouldn't be pompous, exaggerated. 
But most important is that it follow the iceberg or triangle approach to getting to know someone,
i.e. the message I write to her is connected to something about her in her profile, and ideally
invites us to get to know each other more -- especially making her feel implicitly that we like 
each other more and more as we get to know each other more.
This latter part is done because we wrote something connected to her profile. 
Look for parts in her profile that mention "brownie points for X" or "I geek out for Books/Travel". 
The answers can elicit a deeper conversation but writing in simple language is good. 
"Would it be similar like when Gandi said/did X".
Be nuanced and notice little things or what is going on e.g., in what she likes, her profile, etc (why?).
You do read, so try to connect with her in that topic.
If the translated message can be witty, make it witty.
The translated message, can be laced with good-humored banter, to lightened the mood and be fun. 

So here is the general thought process I use when working on messaging people. 
The first and most important is what is this message going to tell her about you, is it a favorable to your end goal or not (goal is to get her interested in you and have a fun conversation). 
With this in mind I then go through the profile. 
If possible I will try and use any context clues about her. 
So for instance, what is she wearing, what shoes, hair, what does her style tell me about her. 
Where is she in the photos, does what’s in the photos match what is going on in the bio. 
Who else is in the pictures. 
What is she emphasizing in here bio? 
Are there things she is speaking about that I also am interested in? 
After going through the bio this is when I start plotting out the iceburgh. 
This is how I set my pace from one convo to another. 
I will normally try and formulate anchor points to help keep the conversation moving as I go through questions in order. The goal is to try and cover my anchors over 3 days and if things are going well and the stream of communication is consistent, that is when I ask for the date. I also try and use poetic language if I can. Important to note, you want the messages to come off as conversational and not an interview. I always try and position as the safe place to come chat. 

This is my current question:
```
Current conversation & response, or context:

Question to rephrase

# -- Notes --

```markdown
steer the conversation to the iceberg strategy 
i.e. have her implicitly feel that she likes me more & more as she gets to know me more

if you connect it to many things in her profile that you can talk more about or even better that connect
to things you genuinely value or like -- the better.

Strategy for messaging someone on a dating app from the Men's side
```markdown
Goal: The main goal is to entice a response that leads to a positive interaction. 
Distinguishable: It has to be different from the other simple responses others are sending (e.g. what is your favorite country instead ask what draws you to a country, culture, food, music, etc. note this assume we already decide that travel is in the top two most important). 
Choosing topic: Choose a topic from her profile that you think is the most important for her, but that I can still build over. 
How you can pick is by cross referencing what they said on their profile with what is available non social media.
Further advice on choosing the topic: normally when you are asking a question around what motivates them to do something or if what they chose turned out the way they expected why and why not, that tends to get results faster
How to develop the topic: We are still using the iceberg/triangle strategy i.e., as we get to know someone the connect grows deeper because we learn that we value similar life styles.  
To develop depth/Pro tip: make sure that any question you ask you have answers for you. 
Example:
topic: With Orge she speaks about travel and how she had been gone for three years
Indistinguishable question: What is your favorite travel location?
Distinguishable/interesting question: 
what draws you to a country, culture, food, music, etc.?
```

Here is a break down of the strategy:  

So here is the general thought process I use when working on messaging people. 
1. The first and most important is **what is this message going to tell her about you**, is it a **favorable to your end goal or not**?
2. With this in mind I then go through the profile. If possible**I will try and use any context clues about her**. So for instance, what is she wearing, what shoes, hair, what does her style tell me about her. 
    i. Where is she in the photos, does what’s in the photos match what is going on in the bio. Who else is in the pictures. What is she emphasizing in here bio? Are there things she is speaking about that I also am interested in? 
3. After going through the bio this is when I start plotting out the iceburgh. This is how I set my pace from one convo to another. I will normally try and formulate anchor points to help keep the conversation moving as I go through questions in order. 
4. The goal is to try and cover my anchors over 3 days and if things are going well and the stream of communication is consistent, that is when I ask for the date. I also try and use poetic language if I can. Important to note, you want the messages **to come off as conversational and not an interview**. I always try and position as the **safe place to come chat**. 

Example form sim

Hey Naz, it’s great to chat with you. I must say reading your greatest life goal reminded me of one of my favorite Dumbledore quotes  "Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light” In ways darkness represents regret to me, so that truly spoke to me, its nice to be reminded that the goal is to keep the light of your soul on and make it through this life without regrets so thank you for that! Was there any turning point where you realized that was the greatest goal for you? 
```markdown

So here I am doing two things at once, introducing the fact that you do read and have done so since childhood **using a book you have read as the anchor**. 
This also opens us up to the Hunger games quote as the follow up. 
I then go on to show appreciation and give a deeper response as to why I feel that gratitude. 
This does one of two things, 
I it shows her that you are a deep thinker, but also that **should you end up together you are able to notice her value**. 
II end with the question as to why it is her greatest goal as you had given her insight into the impact. 
=======
When deciding what prompt to answer, ask yourself, why is she asking?
What do you do in your free time? It's a filtering question. This questions is probably getting a lot of action. There is no point to be a person in the pile to be compared. 
What would be most unique, that aligns with the data that algins with that person. 

> Witty: possessing a quick and clever intellect, often used to deliver humor or insights in a playful manner; also, what one aspires to be when trying to impress at a dinner party.

whats your fav book (don't ask her basic question), instead what are the 5 traits 
help her realize something about herself or you
what draws you to nations around the world
what is your favorite colour, what is unique about the feeling that you get about your favorite colour
what's your favorite food, when you think about the foods you like to eat, what does it tell you about your pallette, what is the story about your pallette, what is it about the way the way you feel when eating your favorite food that is different from other foods

---

pick a date about something she already likes. e.g., she says she geek outs (entice) about books
there is an event that connects us in some way  that entices her/raises her interest so she wants go on a date

Q: how do you raise her interest
associating me with things we have in common
Always raise the interest, what did you learn from this person how can you raise the interest (after each interaction). 
Write message with that in mind. 
My coaches messages was written so that she (the girl we are messaging) would be curious about me. Mystery in a good way.

Make sure you don't ignore her previous response.

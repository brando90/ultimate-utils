# Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT and other LLMs (?)

These are just rough notes about what I'm trying to do. They are unstable and I might change at any time and
I'm not sure if I will always be good at documenting things here. 

## Prompt engineering for ChatGPT

I was trying to create one shot prompts for ChatGPT. 
But it's not been as successful as I hoped. 

**For one shot prompting I've learned this**:
- so far, even if I edit the prompt it still doesn't work very well tbh.
- However, it was trained with RLHF. Can I teach it about my preferences in one prompot? Would that make the one
  shot prompting work better?
- I have noticed that chatting with it improves the output.
- Perhaps Zach is right. I need to figure out not what I think a good prompt is but what type of prompts actually work.
  - (do the courses coursera/deeplearning.ai)
- GPT4 isn't very insightful e.g. it's not capable of writing a conversation starter in one shot for hinge/bumble. 
  - The main issue is that it doesn't realize -- even if you tell it -- to try to connect with the person in a meaningful way.
  - Like going beyond their profile and creating a genuine human connection that would lead to an fun, exciting yet relaxed conversation.

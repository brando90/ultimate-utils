## BUD (Bottlenecks Unnecessary work Duplicated work)

```markdown
B ottlenecks
U nnecessary Work
D uplicated Work
The basic gist of BUD is it represents the three most common tasks that an inefficient solution is wasting time with. An approach would be to walk through you’re brute force algorithm checking for each of these. Then focus on fixing it until it can be improved.
```
- B := The bottleneck is the part of your algorithm that considerably slows down its runtime.
- U := For unnecessary work, we’ll basically restructure the algorithm by finding the other unneeded operations being done and make small changes to adjust for better optimization.
- D

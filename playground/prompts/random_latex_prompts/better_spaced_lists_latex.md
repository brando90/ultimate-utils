# -- Better latex itemization compression --

# Prompt
I have a latex itemization. I want to make it more compact because the white space in the item list is to large. How do I do that? Current code:
```
The key observations from the results are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The diversity coefficient of pre-training datasets tend to be \textbf{3-5 times greater than the theoretical lower bound and, on average, half the upper bound.} 
    Prominently, WikiText-103, c4, The Pile, and Pile-CC exhibit high diversity coefficients (0.21, 0.25).
    \item The measured diversity of Pile-CC is higher than that of c4, indicating a potentially more stringent preprocessing method applied to the Common Crawl corpus for Pile-CC, which contributes to enhanced data diversity.
    \item Three sub-datasets of The Pile, namely NIH ExPorter, PubMed Abstracts, and USPTO, show relatively low diversity (0.15-0.17), approximately half of the upper bound 0.4. The nature of these datasets, curated from specialized fields, may account for this observation.
% - Among the five sub-datasets of The Pile, NIH ExPorter, PubMed Abstracts, and USPTO have low diversity (0.15-0.17) 
% i.e. half of the upper bound 0.4.
% This may be explained by dataset composition, since these datasets were curated from documents of a specialized field. 
% For instance, NIH ExPorter and PubMed Abstracts are medicine-focused. 
% Therefore, these datasets may contain sequences written in specific formats and prose, 
% e.g. patent backgrounds in USPTO may share similar formats and semantics as do abstracts in NIH ExPorter or PubMed Abstracts.
% Therefore, text sequences from these datasets may be more similar structurally and semantically due to their technicality, resulting in low diversity.
    \item However, we observe that the Pile-CC and HackerNews have higher diversity, which may be attributed to their coverage of a broad range of topics. 
    Among these, Pile-CC exhibits higher diversity, in line with its heterogeneous content composition.
% - However, we observe that the Pile-CC and HackerNews have higher diversity.
% We attribute it to the fact that both cover a broader variety of topics. 
% Between the two, Pile-CC has higher diversity, which is consistent with its heterogenous composition. 
% We expect a greater variety of text topics, document formats, etc. from a general web scrape such as Pile-CC vs. a computer science and entrepreneurship focused website.
\end{itemize}

Make sure that the unwanted space between the paragraph before the list and the items is addressed.
Give me the new latex:

I have a couple of different phrasing for a sentence in a scientific paper I am writing in the quotes bellow.
I would like more more re-phrasing options:
"
Option 1: 
We help ground aspects of data quality by examining task coverage via the concrete measure of the diversity coefficient.

Option 2:
Help ground the imprecise discussion of data quality by studying data coverage through the concrete diversity coefficient

---- Create title from abstract ----

Provide me with different impactful titles from the following scientific abstract:
"
Current trends to train capable Large Language Models (LLMs) mostly focus on scaling of model and dataset size.
However, the \textit{quality} of pre-training data is an important factor for training powerful LLMs, yet it is a nebulous concept that has not been fully characterized.
Therefore, we propose to use the diversity coefficient to understand formal aspects of data quality and go beyond scale alone.
We measure the diversity coefficient of open source LLM pre-training datasets to demonstrate their formal diversity is high when compared to the theoretical lower and upper bounds of the diversity coefficient.
In addition, to increase the trust on the diversity coefficient, we conduct interpretability experiments and find it aligns with properties one would expect of a diversity metric e.g. it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. 
Therefore, we conclude the diversity coefficient is reliable and conjecture the diversity coefficient can be used to build diverse datasets for LLMs.

---- Combine into one sentence using anchor sentence ----

Provide me with different re-writes of the text in quotations.
Remain professional, concise, scientifically sounding, persuasive yet simple, that uses the active voice:
Combine the folliwig sentences into a single coherent single concise sentence but use the anchor sentence as the starting point:
"
1st: The success of large scale machine learning systems depends critically on the quantity and quality of data used during training, and we cannot expect these systems to succeed if there is not enough training data or if that data does not cover all the phenomena contained in the test distribution (Ben-David et al., 2010).
2nd: The strong performance (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Nostalgebraist, 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Google, 2023), of modern language models (LMs) depend on self-supervised pretraining on massive text datasets
3rd: One reason to believe this is the phenomenon known as neural scaling laws: empirical observations that deep networks exhibit power law scaling in the test loss as a function of training dataset size, number of parameters or compute \citep{hestness2017deep,rosenfeld2019constructive,henighan2020scaling,kaplan2020scaling,gordon2021data,hernandez2021scaling,jones2021scaling,zhai2022scaling,hoffmann2022training, clark2022unified, neumann2022scaling}.
4th: However, the \textit{quality} of pre-training data is an important factor for training powerful LLMs, yet it is a nebulous concept that has not been fully characterized.
anchor sentence: Current trends to pre-train capable Large Language Models (LLMs) mostly focus on scaling of model and dataset size.

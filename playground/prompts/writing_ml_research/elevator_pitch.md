Current trends to pre-train capable Large Language Models (LLMs) mostly focus on scaling of model and dataset size. However, the quality of pre-training data is an important factor for training powerful LLMs, yet it is a nebulous concept that has not been fully characterized. Therefore, we use the recently proposed Task2Vec diversity coefficient to ground and understand formal aspects of data quality, to go beyond scale alone. Specifically, we measure the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets to demonstrate that their formal diversity is high when compared to theoretical lower and upper bounds. In addition, to build confidence in the diversity coefficient, we conduct interpretability experiments and find that the coefficient aligns with intuitive properties of diversity, e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. We conclude the diversity coefficient is reliable, show it's high for publicly available LLM datasets, and conjecture it can be used to build useful diverse datasets for LLMs

You also need to describe your research in the section 
"Briefly describe your research, methodology, and relevant expense details". 
What is the focus of your research study, field/sub-field? 
You may think of this as your "elevator pitch" about your research focus.

It has to be very concise, much shorter than the abstract I provided,
also say the field of study:

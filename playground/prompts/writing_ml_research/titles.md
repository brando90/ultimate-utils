# Prompt: Better Titles for Impactful Machine Learning Research Paper
Improve my scientific title for a NeurIPS NIPs ICML ICLR machine learning publication (maximizing impact): 
```markdown
%current title
\title{Quantitative Improvements in Data Quality Leads to Improved Performance in LLMs}
```
It should be of top quality for a NeurIPS NIPs ICML ICLR machine learning publication
(do not change citations e.g. \citep{...}, urls or names).
Also, do not change any part that is already excellent.
Capitalize all major words in the title, including nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctions.
Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, for, nor), and prepositions, regardless of 
length, unless they are the first or last word of the title.
Lowercase the 'to' in an infinitive.
Do not sound exaggerated or pompous -- but catchy or memorable is great.
Keep it concise, scientific, use the active voice.
Should be impactful and maybe catchy, controversial, or surprising or interesting -- yet short and accurate factual.

The use of capital letters in titles is generally dictated by the style guide you are using. In English, there are several major style guides, such as the APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), and Chicago Manual of Style. The specific rules can vary between these style guides.

However, in the example you provided, which seems to be in an academic or professional context, you would generally follow APA or Chicago style, which use a method called "title case" or "headline style."

In title case, the following rules are applied:

Capitalize the first and last words of the title, no matter what they are.
Capitalize all major words in the title, including nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctions.
Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, for, nor), and prepositions, regardless of length, unless they are the first or last word of the title.
Lowercase the 'to' in an infinitive.
So your title would be transformed to:

\subsection{Method 1: Choose Top K Sequences of Highest Quality for Pre-Training or Fine-Tuning}

In this corrected title:

'Choose,' 'Top,' 'Sequences,' 'Highest,' 'Quality,' 'Pre-Training,' and 'Fine-Tuning' are all capitalized as they are either the first word, major words, or the last word of the title or its subtitle.
'of,' 'for,' and 'or' are not capitalized as they are prepositions or coordinating conjunctions.
There was a typo in the original version, where 'Chose' should be 'Choose.'

Yes, that's a strong choice! The title clearly communicates the subject of the paper, emphasizing the central role of data quality in enhancing LLMs' performance. It also utilizes an active voice, as per your guidelines, and it sounds interesting without being exaggerated or pompous.

"The Data Quality Edge" catches attention and introduces the focus right away, while the rest of the title provides more detail. This title should effectively draw in readers who are interested in the intersection of data quality and machine learning.

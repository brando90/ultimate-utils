Most of our diversity computations use small models.
There is a debate about emergence in large language models, however, we hypothesize our results generalize to all size models.
We hypothesize this because the observation of emergence is highly dependent on the metric and the sharp unpredictable jumps go away when using smooth metrics \cite{schaeffer2023emergent}.

It should be of top quality for a NeurIPS NIPs ICML ICLR AAAI CVPR machine learning publication
(do not change citations e.g. \citep{...} \cite{...}, urls or names). 
Also, do not change any part that is already excellent. 
Do not sound exaggerated or pompous. 
Keep it concise scientific, use the active voice. 
If it's a list of bullet points, re-write it top quality paragraph or paragraphs.
Use scientific language where appriopriate e.g., using words like conjecture, hypothesis, implication, demonstrate, etc.

I have a couple of different phrasing for a sentence in a scientific paper I am writing in the quotes bellow.
I would like more re-phrasing options:
```text
Option 1: 
We propose to start discussion of data diversity as a metric of data quality, measuring task coverage.

Option 2:
We pioneer discussion on quantitative metrics of data quality by examining task coverage via the concrete measure of the diversity coefficient.
